decaf
=====

Decaf stands for "Compiler Language with No Pronouncable Acronym". It's kinda like Java but a lot less so.

Implemented by Hawk Weisman (@hawkw) and Max Clive (@ArcticLight) for Professor Janyl Jumadinova's CMPSC420 at Allegheny College.

This Scala implementation of the Decaf compiler (`dcc`) is based on the C++/Flex/Bison reference implementation provided by Professor Jumadinova.
